Why Inbound Marketing Is The New Sliced Bread

In the world of marketing, history shows us that it was all about getting the message and brand of a company in front of a variety of consumers.  Advertising agencies and companies have found that 'traditional marketing' approach to work; making it THE best practice.  Until... we took marketing online. 

The Internet is a (hopefully forever) free source of information to worldwide consumers.  Consumers are definitely more informed today than they were say, ten years ago.  This is due to the extent of information available on this here 'superhighway'.  Traditional marketing has saturated the market to such a huge extent that people are tired of it.  It's boring, noisy, and just downright intrusive.  After decades of being assaulted by messages selling you everything and anything, everywhere, inbound marketing is a breath of fresh air.  

So what is Inbound Marketing?  It is a marketing approach where companies put out information about the types of products and services they deal in.  Informing the public makes them authorities on the product/service.  It is also a way to build relationships with people, if the public think of them as authorities on a product/service, they are likely to want more information; they will come back - and so it goes, building up a relationship to educate a customer and only AFTER giving them value, do you offer them information about how your company/service can help them.  This way, it's a 'consumer's choice' and on their terms.

Stay tuned for more informative insights into this fascinating marketing discipline that is as good as sliced bread for any consumer.
